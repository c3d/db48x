# Operations with Symbolic Expressions

## ↑Match

Match pattern up and [rewrite expression](#expression-rewrite), starting with
the innermost subexpressions first. This approach works well for
simplifications. A subexpression simplified during one execution will be a
simpler argument of its parent expression, so the parent expression can be
simplified further.

`Expr` { `From` `To` } ▶ `Expr` `Count`
`Expr` { `From` `To` `Cond` } ▶ `Expr` `Count`

The first argument `Expr` is the expression to transform.

The second argument is a list containing the pattern to match `From`,
the replacement pattern `To`,
and an optional condition `Cond` on the pattern.


## ↓Match

Match pattern down and [rewrite expression](#expression-rewrite), starting with
the outermost expression first. This approach works well for expansion. An
expression expanded during one execution of `↓Match` will contain additional
subexpressions, and those subexpressions can be expanded further.

`Expr` { `From` `To` } ▶ `Expr` `Count`
`Expr` { `From` `To` `Cond` } ▶ `Expr` `Count`

The first argument `Expr` is the expression to transform.

The second argument is a list containing the pattern to match `From`,
the replacement pattern `To`,
and an optional condition `Cond` on the pattern.

## Expression rewrite

Operations such as `↑Match` and `↓Match` apply arbitrary transformations on
algebraic expressions. The way this operates is similar to how HP
calculators perform, but with important differences, controlled by flags.

First, patterns can contain wildcards, which are substituted with the
corresponding sub-expression in the matched `Expr`.

* On HP calculators, the wildcard names must begin with `&`, and only an
  optional external conditions can control what matches or not.

* On DB48X, by default, any name in the pattern acts as a wildcard, and we use
  `&` to refer to a specific variable i.e. `&A` only matches the variable named
  `A`.

Rationale: The default DB48X approach makes it easier to write transformation
rules for the common cases, the `&` character being a bit harder to access on
the calculator's keyboard. The assumption is that we rarely write patterns to
match a specific variable, i.e. replace an expression only if it refers to `X`
but not to `Y`. The HP behaviour can be restored using the `ExplicitWildcards`
flag.

A further extension in DB48X is to give a semantic meaning to the first letter
of variable names:

* `a`, `b` and `c` denote numerical constants, like real or integer values.
* `i`, `j` are positive integer values which may be zero and may be the result
  of a computation, i.e. `3-3` will match.
* `k`, `l`, `m` are non-zero positive integer values, which may be the result of
  a compuation, i.e. `3-2` will match.
* `n`, `o`, `p` are symbols or names like `'ABC'`.
* `u`, `v`, `w` are unique terms, i.e. terms that cannot be presented more than
  once in an expression.
* Names where the initial is lowercase must be sorted, so that `x+y` will match
  `A+B` but not `B+A`.

Another important difference is that on HP calculators, the number of rewrites
of subexpressions is limited to a single pass, irrespective of flag `-100`
(step-by-step CAS mode), whereas DB48X will repeat application by default (this
can be changed by setting `StepByStepAlgebraResults`, or alternatively, by
clearing flag `-100`).

This leads to the last important difference. On HP calculators, `↑Match` and
`↓Match` return either `0` or `1` in the first level of the stack to indicate if
a replacement occurred. On DB48X, the number of replaced subexpressions is
returned, and it can be greater than 1.


Examples:
* `'A+B+0' {'X+0' 'X' } ↓Match` returns `'A+B' 1`
* `'A+B+C' { 'X+Y' 'Y-X' } ↓Match` returns `'C-(B-A)' 2`
* `'(A+B)^3' { 'X^N' 'X*X^(N-1)' } ↓Match` returns `(A+B)*(A+B)^2`.


## AutoSimplify

Enable automatic reduction of numeric subexpressions according to usual
arithmetic rules. After evaluating `AutoSimplify` `'X+0`' will evaluate as `'X'`
and '`X*1-B*0'` witll evaluate as `'X'`.

The opposite setting is [NoAutoSimplify](#noautosimplify)

## NoAutoSimplify

Disable automatic reduction of numeric subexpressions according to usual
arithmetic rules. After evaluating `NoAutoSimplify`, equations such as`'X+0`'
or `X*1-B*0` will no longer be simplified during evaluation.

The opposite setting is [AutoSimplify](#autosimplify)


## FinalAlgebraResults

Evaluate algebraic rules on symbolic expressions repeatedly until no futher change results from applying them.


## StepByStepAlgebraResults

Evaluate algebraic rules on symbolic expressions one step at a time.



## →Num (→Decimal, ToDecimal)

Convert fractions and symbolic constants to decimal form.
For example, `1/4 →Num` results in `0.25`.

## →Frac (→Q, ToFraction)

Convert decimal values to fractions. For example `1.25 →Frac` gives `5/4`.
The precision of the conversion in digits is defined by
[→FracDigits](#ToFractionDigits), and the maximum number of iterations for the
conversion is defined by [→FracDigits](#ToFractionIterations)

## ListExpressionNames (LName)

List all variables used in an expression or polynomial, leaving the original
object on the stack, and returning the result as an array.
Names are sorted in decreasing order of size, and for the same size,
in alphabetical order.

`'A*Foo*G(X;Y;cos Z)`  ▶ `'A*Foo*G(X;Y;cos Z)` `[ Foo A G X Y Z ]`
`'(U_V)=(I_A)*(R_Ω)'`  ▶ `'(U_V)=(I_A)*(R_Ω)'` `[ I R U ]`

As a DB48X extension, this command also applies to programs, list and
arrays. Another extension is the [`ExpressionVariables`](#expressionvariables)
command, which extracts the units associated with the variables if there are
any. The `LName` command only returns the names, without the associated unit.


## ExpressionVariables (XVars)

List all variables used in an expression or polynomial, returning the result as
a list.
Names are sorted in decreasing order of size, and for the same size,
in alphabetical order.
If there are units in the expression, the units are returned in the resulting
list.

`'A*Foo*G(X;Y;cos Z)`  ▶ `{ Foo A G X Y Z }`
`'(U_V)=(I_A)*(R_Ω)'`  ▶ `{ (I_A) (R_Ω) (U_V) }`

This is a variation of the HP command [`LNAME`](#listexpressionnames), which is
a bit more convenient to use in programs.
