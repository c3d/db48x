# Time, Alarms and System Commands

## Date format

The date format is `YYYYMMDD`, with an optional fractional part defining the
time, as in `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`.

Note: the date format is intentionally different from the format on the HP-48.

## Time format

The time format is `HH.MMSS` with optional hundredths of a second as
in `HH.MMSSCC`.


## SetDate

Set current system date.

The date format is `YYYYMMDD`, with an optional fractional part defining the
time, as in `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`. If the fractional part is zero, then the time is
not changed.

Note: the date format is intentionally different from the format on the HP-48.


## Date+

Add days to a [date](#date). The date format is `YYYYMMDD`, with an optional fractional part defining the time, as in `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`, and an optional unit, as in `YYYMMDD_date`.


## SetTime

Set current time from a stack value `HH.MMSSCC`.

An HMS value can also be given, as returned by the `Time` command.


## ToHMS

Convert decimal time to `HH.MMSS` format.


## FomHMS

Convert time in `HH.MMSS` format to decimal time.


## HMS+

Add time in `HH.MMSS` format.


## HMS-

Subtract time in `HH.MMSS` format


## Ticks

Return system clock in milliseconds


## TEVAL
Perform EVAL and measure elapsed time


## Date

Return the current system date as a unit object in the form `YYYYMMDD_date`.
This displays on the stack according to date format settings, in a way similar
to what is shown in the header, e.g. `23/Feb/2024` or `2024-02-23`.


## DateTime

Return the current system date as a unit object in the form `YYYYMMDD_date`.
This displays on the stack according to date format settings, in a way similar
to what is shown in the header, e.g. `23/Feb/2024` or `2024-02-23`.

## DDays

Number of days between dates.


## Time

Return the current system time as a unit object in the form `HH.MMSS_hms`.
This displays on the stack as `HH:MM:SS`.

## TSTR


## JulianDayNumber

Return the Julian day number for the given date and time

## ACK
Acknowledge oldest alarm (dismiss)


## ACKALL
Acknowledge (dismiss) all alarms


## RCLALARM
Recall specified alarm


## STOALARM
Create a new alarm


## DELALARM
Delete an existing alarm


## FINDALARM
Get first alarm due after the given time


## Version

Return DB48X version information as text.

 ▶ `"Version information"`


## FreeMemory

Return the number of bytes immediately available in memory, without performing a
cleanup of temporary values (garbage collection).

## AvailableMemory

Return the number of bytes available in memory.

*Remark*: The number returned is only a rough indicator of usable memory.
In particular, [recovery features](#LastThingsMenu) consume or release varying
amounts of memory with each operation.

Before it can assess the amount of memory available, `AvailableMemory` removes
objects in temporary memory that are no longer being used. Like on the HP48, you
can therfore use `MEM` `DROP` to force garbage collection. However, there is
also a dedicated command for that, [GarbageCollect](#GarbageCollect).

## GarbageCollect

Perform a clean-up of temporary objects and return number of bytes reclaimed.

In order to speed up normal operations, temporaries are only discarded when
necessary to make room. This clean-up process, also called *garbage collection*,
occurs automatically when memory is full. Since garbage collection can slow down
calculator operation at undesired times, you can force it to occur at a desired
time by executing [GarbageCollect](#GarbageCollect).

## Bytes

Return the size of the object and a hash of its value. On classic RPL systems,
teh hash is a 5-nibbles CRC32. On DB48X, the hash is a based integer of the
current [wordsize](#stws) corresponding to the binary representation of the
object.

For example, the integer `7` hash will be in the form `#7xx`, where `7` is the
value of the integer, and `xx` represents the integer type, as returned by the
[Type](#type) command.

`X` ▶ `Hash` `Size`


## Type

Return the type of the object as a numerical value. The value is not guaranteed
to be portable across versions of DB48X (and pretty much is guarantteed to _not_
be portable at the current stage of development).

If the `CompatibleTypes` setting is active, the returned value roughly matches
the value returned by the HP50G. It always returns `29` for arrays, not `3`
(real array) nor `4` (complex array). It returns `1` for both polar and
rectangular complex numbers, irrespective of their precision. 128-bit decimal
values return `21` (extended real), 32-bit and 64-bit return `0` (real number).
The separation between `18` (built-in function) and `19` (built-in command) may
not be accurate.

If the `DetailedTypes` setting is active, the return value is negative, and
matches the internal representation precisely. For example, distinct values will
be returned for fractions and expressions.

*Note* The [TypeName](#typename) command returns the type as text, and
this is less likely to change from one release to the next. DB48X-only code
should favor the use of `TypeName`, both for portability and readability.

## TypeName

Return the [type](#Type) of the object as text. For example, `12 type` returns
`"integer"`.


## PEEK
Low-level read memory address


## POKE
Low level write to memory address


## NEWOB
Make a new copy of the given object


## USBFWUPDATE


## PowerOff

Turn calculator off programmatically


## SystemSetup

Display the built-in system setup


## SaveState

Save the machine's state to disk, using the current state if one was previously
loaded. This is intended to quickly save the state for example before a system
upgrade.


## ScreenCapture

Capture the current state of the screen in a dated file stored on the flash storage under the `SCREENS/` directory. This is activated by *holding* 🟨 and _O_ simultaneously. Pressing the keys one after another activates the [DisplayMenu](#displaymenu).
