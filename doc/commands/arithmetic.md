# Arithmetic

## + (add)

Add two values.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y+X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical addition. For example, `1 2 +` is `3`.
* For equations and symbols, build a sum, eliminating zero additions if
  [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.
* For lists, concatenate lists, or add objets to a list. For example, `{ A } { B
  } +` is `{ A B }`, and `{ A B C } "D" +` is `{ A B C "D" }`.
* For text, concatenate text, or concatenate the text representation of an
  object to an existing text. For example `"X" "Y" + ` gives `"XY"`, and
  `"X=" 1 +` gives `"X=1"`.

## - (sub)

Subtract two values

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y-X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical subtraction. For example, `1 2 -` is `-1`.
* For equations and symbols, build a difference, eliminating subtraction of 0 if
  [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.


## × (*, mul)

Multiply two values.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y×X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical multiplication. For example, `3 2 *` is `6`.
* For vectors, multiply individual elements (this is a deviation from HP48).
  For example, `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] +` is `[ 4 10 18 ]`.
* For matrices, perform a matrix multiplication.
* For a matrix and a vector, apply the matrix to the vector.
* For equations and symbols, build a product, eliminating mulitplication by 1
  or 0 when [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.
* For a list and a positive integer, repeat the list For example, `{ A } 3 *`
  is `{ A A A }`.
* For a text and a positive integer, repeat the text. For example `"X" 3 * `
  gives `"XXX"`.


## ÷ (/, div)

Divide two values two values

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y÷X`

* For integer, build a fraction. For example `1 7 /` gives `1/7`.
* For fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this performs the
  expected numerical division. For example, `1. 2. /` is `0.5`.
* For vectors, divide individual elements. For example,
  `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 3 2 1 ] /` is `[ 1/3 1 3 ]`.
* For equations and symbols, build a ratio, eliminating division by one
  and division of 0 when [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.


## ↑ (^, pow)

Raise to the power

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y↑X`

* For integer, fractional, decimal or complex numbers, this raises the
  value in level 2 to the value in level 1. For example, `2 3 ↑` is `8`.
* For vectors, raise individual elements in the first vector to the power of the
  corresponding element in the second vector.
* For equations and synbols, build an expression, eliminating special cases
  when [autosimplify](#autosimplify) is active.


## xroot

Raise to the inverse power. `X Y xroot` is equivalent to `X Y inv pow`.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y↑(1/X)`

On HP calculators, this only applies for polynomials.

On DB48X, this applies to integers, big integers, decimals, fractions and
polynomials. It puts both the quotient and the remainder on the stack. For many
data types, this operation is significantly more efficient than computing the
quotient and the remainder separately.
