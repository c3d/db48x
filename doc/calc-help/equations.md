#### PN Step Junctions

These equations for a silicon PN-junction diode use a “two-sided step-junction” model–the doping density changes
abruptly at the junction. The equation assume the current density is determined by minority carries injected across
the depletion region and the PN junction is rectangular in its layout, The temperature should be between 77 and 500
K.

#### NMOS Transistor

These equations for a silicon NMOS transistor use a two-port network model. They include linear and nonlinear
regions in the device characteristics and are based on a gradual-channel approximation (the electric fields in the
direction of current flow are small compared to those perpendicular to the flow). The drain current and
transconductance calculations differ depending on whether the transistor is in the linear, saturated, or cutoff region.
The equations assume the physical geometry of the device is a rectangle, second-order length-parameter effects are
negligible, shot-channel, hot-carrier, and velocity-saturation effects are negligible, and subthreshold currents are
negligible.

#### Bipolar Transistors

These equations for an NPN silicon bipolar transistor are based on large-signal models developed by J.J. Ebers and
J.L. Moll. The offset-voltage calculation differs depending on whether the transistor is saturated or not. The
equations also include the special conditions when the emitter-base or collector-base junction is open, which are
convenient for measuring transistor parameters.

#### JFETs

These equations for a silicon N-channel junction field-effect transistor (JFET) are based on the single-sided stepjunction
approximation, which assumes the gates are heavily doped compared to the channel doping,. The draincurrent
calculation differs depending on whether the gate-junction depletion-layer thickness is less than or greater
than the channel thickness. The equations assume the channel is uniformly doped and end effects (such as contact,
drain, and source resistances) are negligible.

The relativistic transformations are parametrized by the real constant v representing a velocity confined to the x-direction. The respective inverse transformation is then parameterized by the negative of this velocity.

#### Lorentz Transformation

The primed reference frame (xp, yp, zp) is travelling with velocity v in the positive x direction. Therefore, the y and z coordinates of the rest frame remain unchanged.

#### Time Dilation

The dilation comes from the fact that the Lorentz factor γ is greater or equal to one and the proper time interval is multiplied by γ.

#### Space Contraction

The contraction comes from the fact that the Lorentz factor γ is greater or equal to one and the proper space interval is divided by γ.

#### Velocity Superposition

These expressions replace the usual Galilean addition of velocities. It can be checked that superposing with v = c leads to upx = c, hence the impossibility to superpose velocities to go beyond the velocity limit c. Since the velocity v is confined to the x-direction, the y and z components of velocity remain unchanged.

#### Acceleration Superposition

Even the velocity v is confined to the x-direction, all components of the observed acceleration are transformed in the moving frame.

#### E & B Fields Transformation

#### Longitudinal Doppler Effect

#### Transverse Doppler Effect

#### Energy & Momentum

The total relativistic energy E and the norm of the momentum p form the invariant mo·c^2 which remains the same in all frames The kinetic energy K is the difference between the total relativistic energy E and the rest energy E0 = mo·c^2.

#### Gravitational Time Dilation

#### Gravitational Redshift

#### Circumnavigating Airplanes

It is assumed that the planes are circumnavigating at the same altitude h, same latitude φ and the during same flight duration Δt measured in the airplanes. The ground is rotating with the planet at the angular frequency ω. The Schwarzschild metric is taken into account. The calculation should formally invokes an integral for the elapsed proper time along a path and is approximated here to the first order in speed since the velocities of the plane and the planet surface are << c (slow airplanes over a slow rotating planet).

#### Clocks at different heights

It is assumed that the two clocks are at rest with respect to the ground at a latitude φ and are rotating with the planet at the angular frequency ω. The clocks are at their respective heights h1 and h2 for inxtance at the top and bottom of a mountain. For simplicity, the planet is assumed to have a spherical distribution. The Schwarzschild metric is taken into account. The calculation should formally invokes an integral for the elapsed proper time along a path and is approximated here to the first order in speed since the tangential velociies at height h1 and h2 are << c (slow rotating planet).

#### Planck & Wien Comparison

In this section 2 comparisons are done between the Planck and Wien spectral distributiona. Based on a incomplete thermodynamic argument, the latter is an approximation of the true Planck law describing the spectral distribution for the light emitted by a black-body. The choice of temperature determines the frequency ranges for integration between f1 and f2, or between f3 and f4. One shall determine in which frequency interval both distribution differs notably or agree. The asymptotic agreement for large frequency is clearly illustrated in the picture. The user is free to choose one or the other comparison fractions (replacing it in Frfafb) to compute the corresponding enissive power and the heat transfer rate from the black-body.

#### Planck & Rayleigh-Jeans Comparison

In this section 2 comparisons are done between the Planck and Rayleigh-Jeans spectral distributiona. Based on the equipartition theorem argument, the latter is an approximation of the true Planck law describing the spectral distribution for the light emitted by a black-body. The choice of temperature determines the frequency ranges for integration between f1 and f2, or between f3 and f4. One shall determine in which frequency interval both distribution agree or differs considerably, leading to a divergence called UV catastrophy corresponding to unphysical fractions greather than one. The asymptotic agreement for small frequency is clearly illustrated in the picture. The user is free to choose one or the other comparison fractions (replacing it in Frfafb) to compute the corresponding enissive power and the heat transfer rate from the black-body.
